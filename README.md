# SMS-Classifier-NaiveBayes

Naive Bayes finds applications in spam detection. Weâ€™ll build an SMS spam classifier and compare the results of Multinomial NB and Bernoulli NB.

In recent times, the internet and social media have become the fastest and easiest ways to get information. Today messages, reviews and opinions have become a significant source of information. In this era, Short message service or SMS is considered one of the most powerful means of communication. As the dependence on mobile devices has drastically increased over the period of time it has led to an increased number of attacks in the form of SMS Spam. Thanks to advancement in technologies, we are now able to extract meaningful information from such data using various AI techniques.

The main aim is to understand how to build an SMS spam detection model. We will build the classifier using both multinomial and bernoulli naive bayes to detect whether a text message is a spam or not.
